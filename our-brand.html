                    <h4>Communication Strategy</h4>
                    <p>Our communication strategy will be a three-steps strategy: <span class="orange">gaining notoriety</span>, <span class="orange">being preferred to our direct competitors</span> and <span class="orange">fostering customer loyalty</span>. First of all, the target has to be informed about the Palais 12 and the quality of it. Then, once our notoriety is established, we have to seduce the prospects in order to make them choose the Palais 12. And finally, we have to convince them to take part in the events organised in the Palais 12.</p>
                    <p>
                    	We will follow the following steps to define our communication strategy:
						<ol>
							<li>Define the target of the campaign</li>
							<li>Choose the desired effect and on which term</li>
							<li>Budget</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>We are going to launch two communication campaigns: the first B2B and the second B2C.<br>As always, our complete Communication Strategy can be found in the <a href="downloads.html">published files</a> section.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="team-title">
        		<h3>B2B Campaign</h3>
        	</div>
        	<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        		The obvious target here are our customers : the <span class="orange">producers</span>, <span class="orange">event organizers</span> and <span class="orange">businesses</span>.
        	</p>
            <div class="row">
            	<div class="about-us-text span12">
            		<p>Taking place in Belgium and the North of France, our B2B strategy differs from the B2C one.
					Hypothesis is made that producers, event organizers and businesses are <span class="orange">well informed</span> about the Palais 12 because of the scarcity of places of this kind on the Belgian market. So, it is not necessary to launch awareness campaigns such as for B2C. Thus, we decided to have a constant strategy on the middle term (3 years to begin with). However, the market is continuously evolving and new entrants show up all the time. Our communication strategy has to follow this evolution, so we will <span class="orange">continuously challenge</span> our existing strategy to test its accuracy.</p>

					<p>We will launch a conviction and differentiation campaign to convince them to come to us. It will consist in an <span class="orange">e-mailing</span> campaign to inform them of the characteristics of our service. We will put forward the multipurposity of the Palais 12 by joining our brochure. Moreover, our sales manager will also <span class="orange">meet each producers</span> in person to convince them of our uniqueness as well as to share with them how the end users are enthousiastic about the kind of event they manage. The goal of these meetings is to make them take action and start doing business with us.
					We also rely on word-of-mouth. So if our first customers are seduced, others should follow.</p>
					<p>The main aspect of this communication strategy is the <span class="orange">package system</span>, as explained in the <a href="pricing.html">Pricing</a> page.</p>
            	</div>

            <div class="team-title">
        		<h3>B2C Campaign</h3>
        	</div>
        	<p style="margin-top: 10px;">The target of this campaign is our <span class="orange">end users</span>. As we mentioned before, we aim to promote the Palais 12 among end users so that we can more easily sell our product to producers, who won't have any other choice but to sign it, noticing that end users are already convinced. What producers are looking for is indeed a sucessful event with great public for the artist starred. Our communication strategy will be an <span class="orange">evolutive, incremental strategy</span>.</p>

            	<div class="about-us-text span4" style="text-align: justify;">
            		<h4 style="text-align: center;">Raising Brand Awareness</h4>
					<p>Accordingly with our targeting, we want to get high notoriety among the <span class="orange">16-35 years old</span> taking part in big events, more precisely the <span class="orange">trend setters</span>.</p>
					<p>We will target all the communities of Belgium and the North of France, focusing in the beginning on Brussels, being present on <span class="orange">every type of media</span>: TV, radio and internet through advertisements.
					We will also use <span class="orange">direct marketing</span> through e-mailing, flyering and billboards near universities and schools.</p>
					<p>We also plan on making good use of the <span class="orange">free promotion</span> we'll receive through the Neo Project mediatization.</p>
            	</div>
            	<div class="about-us-text span4" style="text-align: justify;">
            		<h4 style="text-align: center;">Brand Image and Differentitation</h4>
            		<p>
						After making our early adopters aware of the Palais 12, we still need to build a strong <span class="orange">brand image</span>.
						We will target specific places frequented by those people (universities, schools, bars, etc.).
						This campaign should last <span class="orange">about 5 years</span>, while assessing each year its effectiveness and making improvements.
					</p>
					<p>
						We will use advertising through <span class="orange">TV and radio spots</span> but also through <span class="orange">social networks</span>. However, contrary to the awareness campaign, the message will not focus on the Palais 12 itself but more on the product and what differentiates us from our competitors.
					</p>
            	</div>
            	<div class="about-us-text span4" style="text-align: justify;">
            		<h4 style="text-align: center;">Seduction and Customer Loyalty</h4>
            		<p>
            			We will advertise specifically in places frequented by the targeted people (universities, schools, bars, etc.). This campaign is going to be more about <span class="orange">day-to-day advertising</span> depending on the events we will host.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like the previous campaigns, we will be present on TV, radio, social networks as well as on billboards but this campaign will put forward the <span class="orange">artists hosted</span>, the <span class="orange">price</span> and <span class="orange">surrounding facilities</span>. The aim here is to stress out the fact that the Palais 12 is the place where big events happen. We will leverage the notoriety of the artists hosted to put the Palais 12 forward.
