                    <h4>Gaining insights on our final customers</h4>
                    <p>To have a better understanding of the underlying mechanics of our market, we conducted <span class="orange">two field surveys</span>. The first was qualitative, whereas the other was quantitative.<br>
                    They were aimed at our customers' customers, but gave us a better feeling for what our product had to offer.</p>
                </div>

            		<h5>Qualitative Survey</h5>
                    <p>
                    	Out of thirteen 20-minutes face-to-face interviews, we observed that activities such as <span class="orange">sports, culture, gardening and parties</span> were recurring in the schedules of our interviewees.<br>
                    	We also observed that a link could be noticed between the age of the interviewee, their social status and their practised activities. Such a result was highly expected, but we had to double-check it on the field to make sure of its objectivity.
                    	Another interesting point was that <span class="orange">surroundings</span> were really important in the mind of our interviewees.<br>
                    	Finally, we found out that more people that we would have expected had <span class="orange">already heard</span> about the Neo Project, whereas only few of those people actually knew what was the Palais 12 and its purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>All those findings were highly important in the making of our quantitative survey questions.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to have more information about this survey, extensive details can be found on our <a href="downloads.html">published files</a> section.</p>

            	<div class="about-us-text span6">
            		<h5>Quantitative Survey</h5>
                    <p>
                    	The three major age groups put forward through the survey are the following ones : <span class="orange">16-25</span>, <span class="orange">25-35</span>, <span class="orange">35+</span>. In those age groups, a clear link between age and status was easily established. The younger were mainly students, whereas the older were freelances or in the upper-management.<br>
						Regarding their leisure budget, the 16-25 tend to <span class="orange">spend less</span> with an average of 40€ to 80€ per month, whereas the 25-35 spend between 80€ and 120€ per month, the other groups spending more (between 120€ and 160€).<br>
						As for their activities, the 16-35 group tend to go mostly to <span class="orange">parties, concerts and festivals</span>, confirming the trend observed in the qualitative survey.<br>
						Finally, on the facilities where those events take place, no clear distinction between groups was observed. However, the 16-35 seemed to <span class="orange">care less</span> about the facilities, while the older were more concerned with this aspect.
